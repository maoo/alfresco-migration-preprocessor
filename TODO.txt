1. AlfrescoReflectionUtils: merge the following methods into one:
 + getAlfrescoMeta
 + getNodeType
 + getNodeTypeAspects
 + getNodeAspects

2. Add listeners during conversion to inject custom behaviour:
+ Before the JavaBeanConverter gets invoked
+ Before the file/folder gets created
+ Before the meta properties get serialized into the XML file
+ When child/peer associations get handled

3. Implement and register a default listener and delegate some logic (see #2)

4. Use http://code.google.com/p/reflections to auto-wire into AlfrescoXStreamMarshaller:
+ XStream annotated beans
+ Custom (XStream) converters
+ Custom listeners

5. Add multi-threading capabilities

6. Simplify usage by using Spring, alfresco-global.properties and JMX

7. Documentation (small blogpost on how to use it on API level)

8. Alfresco Share Console page, which allows to
+ start/monitor XML uploading
+ see beans, converters and listeners being registered
(preferably same of JMX)
